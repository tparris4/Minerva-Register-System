The  Department of Art unites the disciplines of art, graphic design, art history, and visual theory in a comprehensive program that professionalizes students for careers in art, education, and the creative industries.

The Art Faculty  takes a full spectrum approach to developing all the cognitive skills of our students to help ensure their success in their future endeavors. Students are given ample opportunity in the classroom and in the studio to exercise, develop, and refine their analytical and technical skills along with their creative and expressive abilities.
