               The computer science program offers BA and BS degrees, as well as combined BA/MS and BS/MS degrees. Students who earn the BA are prepared either for graduate study in computer science or a career in industry. Students who earn the BS degree build strength in an additional field by following an approved course of study in a related area. The department also offers a minor. Furthermore, a computer science major or minor serves as an excellent foundation for work in other fields, including but not limited to mathematics, the natural sciences, social sciences, public administration, and the arts.
