           The word doctor is derived from the Latin verb docere, meaning to teach. At many points during a physician's career, from medical school through residency and into practice, he or she will be expected to educate peers, students and faculty. This elective seeks to provide fourth year medical student-teachers (STs) the opportunity to gain and develop pedagogical knowledge, skills and attitudes. We will accomplish this through three approaches: a standard didactic curriculum, opportunities for practical application of theoretical learning and, finally, the expectation to work with a faculty member of their choice on a curricular enhancement project. Undergraduate Degree in Biochemistry or Biogenetics Required.
