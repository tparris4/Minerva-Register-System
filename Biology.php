               The curriculum in biology provides general and specific courses for non-majors and prepares the major for graduate study in biology; the professional schools of human and veterinary medicine, dentistry, optometry, and allied health sciences. Additionally, the curriculum prepares the non-major and major student with knowledge required for careers in secondary science education, environmental education, wildlife management in both the public and private sectors, and other careers dependent upon comprehension of biological sciences. The Department of Biology also has a well established Honors curriculum for those students who excel in academics and wish to participate in biological research. This program allows students to conduct research under the mentorship of faculty in the Department of Biology or the School of Medicine, and to graduate with departmental honors.
