    <td>Fundamentals of Mathematics - MAT 302</td>
    <td> Students will learn how to read, understand, devise and communicate proofs of mathematical statements. A number of proof techniques (contrapositive, contradiction, and especially induction) will be emphasized. Topics to be discussed include set theory (Cantor's notion of size for sets and gradations of infinity, maps between sets, equivalence relations, partitions of sets), basic logic (truth tables, negation, quantifiers), and number theory (divisibility, Euclidean algorithm, congruences). Other topics will be included as time allows.</td>

    <td>Writing in Mathematics - MAT 303</td>
    <td>Essentially all serious mathematics is written using some variant of the LaTeX software, and developing proficiency with this tool is an important part of the course. We will cover a variety of types of writing related to mathematics, such as: critique of seminar presentations and written articles; (auto)biography of mathematicians; expository writing about mathematical topics; aspects of writing a research article; opinion pieces; precise short communications (e.g. abstract, memo, tweet, blog post, newspaper headline); essays about aspects of mathematical culture (e.g. jokes, songs, anecdotes, sociological aspects)..</td>

    <td>Complex Variables - MAT 305</td>
    <td>An introduction to functions of a complex variable. Topics include: Complex numbers, functions of a complex variable and their derivatives (Cauchy-Riemann equations). Harmonic functions. Contour integration and Cauchy's integral formula. Liouville's theorem, Maximum modulus theorem, and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.</td>

    <td>This course is a proof-based introduction to elementary number theory. We will quickly review basic properties of the integers including modular arithmetic and linear Diophantine equations covered in Math 300 or CS250. We will proceed to study primitive roots, quadratic reciprocity, Gaussian integers, and some non-linear Diophantine equations. Several important applications to cryptography will be discussed.</td>

    <td>This is a rigorous introduction to some topics in mathematics that underlie areas in computer science and computer engineering, including graphs and trees, spanning trees, and matchings; the pigeonhole principle, induction and recursion, generating functions, and discrete probability proofs (time permitting). The course integrates learning mathematical theories with applications to concrete problems from other disciplines using discrete modeling techniques. Student groups will be formed to investigate a concept or an application related to discrete mathematics, and each group will report its findings to the class in a final presentation. </td>

    <td>This is the first part of the introduction to analysis sequence (523 and 524). This course deals with basic concepts of analysis of functions mostly on the real line, and we will try to make many of the concepts one learns in calculus rigorous. Covered topics will include series, and sequences, continuity, differentiability, and integration.</td>
