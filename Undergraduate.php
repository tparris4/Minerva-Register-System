UNDERGRADUATE APPLICANT
DEFINITIONS
The following definitions apply to all U.S. citizens, permanent residents,
and international applicants. The 
International Admissions
 section
includes additional details specific to international applicants and U.S.
citizens/permanent residents educated outside the U.S.
Freshman/First-Year Students 
Transfer Students
Second Bachelor's/Post-Bachelor Candidates
Returning Students
Freshman/First-Year 
You are a freshman/first-year applicant if you've never attended college
OR all of your college credits were earned prior to high school graduation
(or equivalent).
•
Refer to instructions for dual/concurrent enrollment if you’ve taken
college course work during or as your high school curriculum.
•
Details for students who did not graduate from high
school, homeschooled, graduated early, or completed an online high
school diploma are below.
•
Freshman decision factors also apply to transfer applicants with
fewer than 30 post-high school credits at the point of application.
Refer to the freshman/first-year application guide

 on the Admissions website
for details.
Specialized Freshman/First-Year Populations 
This information applies to freshman/first-year applicants 
and
 transfer
applicants with fewer than 30 post-high school credits at the point of
application.
Dual/Concurrent Enrollment Applicants 
See the Admissions website for dual/concurrent enrollment applicants


Applicants whose 
only
 college course work has been completed during
high school or as their high school curriculum are considered freshman/
first-year applicants with dual/concurrent enrollment.
While high school credentials still are the primary basis for the admission
decision for dual/concurrent enrollment students, college performance
can be considered in the admission decision and is considered a
demonstration of academic rigor comparable to completion of Advanced
Placement (AP) and/or International Baccalaureate (IB) work. Courses
will be evaluated for advanced-standing credit after an applicant is
otherwise deemed admissible.
Dual/concurrent enrollment students are eligible for freshman/first-year
scholarships and are required to live in the residence halls.
